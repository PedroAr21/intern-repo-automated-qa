What are the most common causes of flaky tests in WinAppDriver?
Flaky tests in winappdriver is often due to timing issues, like webview elements in focus bear not loading before clicks. network delays, even inconsistent windows builds, and ui changes also cause flakiness.

How do implicit waits help prevent timing-related test failures?
Implicit waits help by making winappdriver wait for elements to appear before interacting.

When should explicit waits be used instead of implicit waits?
Use explicit waits (waituntil) in focus bear tests when specific conditions are needed, like ensuring a webview button is clickable or has text. Implicit waits are too broad for dynamic ui states, while explicit waits target precise scenarios, avoiding unnecessary delays or failures.

How does retry logic help with test stability, and when should it be avoided?
Retry logic in focus bear tests reattempts webview actions if they fail, improving stability against network or timing issues. avoid it when failures indicate real bugs.

What strategies can prevent flaky tests in large test suites?
Prevent flaky tests in focus bear by using pom, explicit waits, and isolated tests.
