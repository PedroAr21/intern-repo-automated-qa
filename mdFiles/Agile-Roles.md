What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?
My role is to test the app, identify defects and ensure functionality meets user needs. I contribute to the Agile process by providing feedback during sprints or Kanban cycles, and helping maintain quality, enabling developers to refine the product and ensuring reliable delivery for users.

How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?
My QA responsibilities overlap with developers, as I test their code and report bugs and collaborating to fix them.
