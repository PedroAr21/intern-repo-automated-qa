How does Appium work, and why is it widely used for E2E testing?
Appium uses the WebDriver protocol to automate interactions with mobile and desktop apps. It translates test commands into platform-specific actions. Itâ€™s popular for end-to-end (E2E) testing because it supports multiple languages, devices (Android, iOS, Windows), and frameworks, allowing full user journey testing across platforms with one unified API.

What are the benefits of using WinAppDriver over tools like Pywinauto?
WinAppDriver supports multiple programming languages through the WebDriver standard, unlike Pywinauto, which is Python-only.

How does WebDriver help standardize automation across mobile and desktop?
WebDriver defines a universal API for controlling browsers and applications, regardless of platform. Appium and tools like WinAppDriver implement this protocol, allowing developers to write one test syntax for Android, iOS, and Windows.

What types of Windows applications can be tested with WinAppDriver?
WinAppDriver can test Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps, classic Win32 apps, WinForms, and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) applications.
