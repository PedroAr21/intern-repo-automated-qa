How does running tests in CI/CD help maintain application stability?
Ensures that features are validated automatically. Each code change triggers WinAppDriver tests, catching bugs early.

What are the challenges of running GUI-based tests in CI/CD pipelines?
Require a Windows environment, increasing CI resource demands. Environment differences cause false results, and tests are slow, delaying pipelines.

How can flaky tests be handled in a CI/CD environment?
Can be managed by adding retries in GitHub Actions or using JavaScript wait conditions (driver.sleep).

What would be the next steps to fully integrate Focus Bearâ€™s automated tests into its deployment pipeline?
Write more WinAppDriver tests for Focus Bear features like habit tracking. Add them to GitHub Actions to run automatically.
