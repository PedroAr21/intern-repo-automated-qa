What is the difference between staging and committing?
Staging prepares changes for a commit by adding them to the index using git add, while committing saves those changes to the repository with git commit.

Why does Git separate these two steps?
Git separates staging and committing to give developers control over what changes to include in a commit.

When would you want to stage changes without committing?
youâ€™re not ready to save them permanently, like when organizing multiple changes for a logical commit later.
