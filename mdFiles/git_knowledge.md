Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?
Yes, I used to use GitHub in the activities of my university assignments for merging code with my university friends' group.

Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?
I chose two: GitHub Desktop and Git Bash because they complement each other.

What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?
The most interesting this I learned was that I can troubleshoot any issue by using GitHub Desktop and Git Bash together.
