What caused the conflict?
When two branches were modified in the same part of a file, a merge conclict occurs.

How did you resolve it?
I fixed the same part of the file in both branches, and I wrote the file in each branch correctly without interfrence.

What did you learn?
I learned that we should carefully edit or write each file without overlapping changes before merging them.
