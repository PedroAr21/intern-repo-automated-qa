What are the most common reasons for E2E test failures?
E2E test failures due to timing issues, like elements not loading in Focus Bearâ€™s WebView, network delays, or UI changes breaking locators.

How do you determine if a test is flaky?
A test is flaky if it passes or fails inconsistently under the same conditions.

What strategies can you use to improve test reliability?
Adding retry logic for WebView interactions in Focus Bear tests, and using explicit waits for element loading.

How can logging and screenshots help with debugging test failures?
Logging in WinAppDriver tests captures errors like timeouts in Focus Bear, guiding me to the issue. Screenshots show UI states, revealing missing elements.
