What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?
I currently use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on work accounts, and keep software updated.

How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?
To make secure behavior habitual, I’ll set daily reminders to update software, lock my computer, and review phishing emails.

What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?
I’ll create strong, unique passwords (12+ characters, mix of types) using a password manager, enable 2FA on all accounts, and regularly update passwords.

What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?
If I suspected a breach, I’d immediately lock my account, change passwords, and enable 2FA if not already active, and I’d notify IT or Focus Bear’s security team.
