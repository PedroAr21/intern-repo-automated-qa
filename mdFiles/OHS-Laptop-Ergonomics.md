What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup? (e.g., using an external monitor, adjusting your chair, using a laptop stand)
I can improve my workspace by using an external monitor at eye level, adjusting my ergonomic chair for lumbar support, and using a laptop stand with an external keyboard and mouse.

What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain? (e.g., sitting upright, taking regular breaks, adjusting screen height)
I’ll sit upright with shoulders relaxed, take regular 5-minute breaks hourly using Focus Bear’s Micro Breaks, and adjust my screen height to eye level.

How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day? (Hint: Use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks!)
I’ll use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks during Micro Breaks or Evening Routines.
