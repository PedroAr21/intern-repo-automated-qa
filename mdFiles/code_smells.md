What code smells did you find in your code?
long functions, duplicate code, large classes, commented-out code (unused function), and inconsistent naming.

How did refactoring improve the readability and maintainability of the code?
Refactoring simplifies code structure, removes redundancy, and clarifies intent with better naming and organization. This makes it easier to read and understan while reducing complexity.

How can avoiding code smells make future debugging easier?
Avoiding code smells reduces complexity, like removing nested conditionals or duplicates, making code easier to follow. Clear naming and constants improve understanding, while eliminating commented-out code prevents confusion, allowing you to quickly identify and fix bugs.
