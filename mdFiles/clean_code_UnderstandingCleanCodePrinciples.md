Clean Code Principles

Simplicity
Write code that does only what is needed. Avoid unnecessary complexity and clever tricks.

Readability
Use descriptive names and clear formatting. Make the code self-explanatory.

Maintainability
Use modular code with clear logic and comments when necessary, so others can modify it easily.

Consistency
Stick to the coding style and naming conventions of the project or language.

Efficiency
Avoid redundant calculations or data structures. Write code that runs well, but avoid premature optimization.
