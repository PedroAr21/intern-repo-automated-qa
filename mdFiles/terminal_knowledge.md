Which terminal client did you choose? Why?
I chose Windows terminal (CMD) and Power Shell because I have a Windows device and have prior experience with these tools.

What customizations (if any) did you make?
I usually use the default terminal.

What was the most useful command you learned today?
dir
Because it displays directories we can select later using another command.
