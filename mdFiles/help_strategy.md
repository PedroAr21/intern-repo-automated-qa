When do you prefer using AI vs. searching Google?
I prefer AI for quick syntax fixes or code snippets, like when I needed a regex pattern for Focus Bear. It’s fast and conversational. I use Google for deeper research if it is necessary.

How do you decide when to ask a colleague instead?
I ask a colleague when the issue is urgent, like a crashing app before a deadline, or involves sensitive data, such as user info in Focus Bear.

What challenges do developers face when troubleshooting alone?
Troubleshooting alone, I struggle with missing context, like not knowing Focus Bear’s backend setup, which leads to wrong solutions.
