What is the difference between E2E, unit, and integration testing?
E2E tests the entire system app, unit tests a small piece of code, like a function, and integration tests the app's logic.

What are the key benefits of E2E tests in a real-world application?
It ensures the app works as expected for users by testing real scenarios, and it minimizes manual testing by catching bugs earlier and faster. 

How does automated testing help Focus Bear reduce regression bugs?
Catching issues early when I a new feature is released, or automating real user scenarios to verify core integrations and maintain the app's performance.

What are some challenges of writing and maintaining E2E tests?
They require setting up test environments, including test data like user account. However, and one key aspect to consider is when the app's logic changes, such as a button's name or layout being updated, which requires constant test updates.
