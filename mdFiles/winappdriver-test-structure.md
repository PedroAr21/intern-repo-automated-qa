What are the key principles of maintainable E2E test code?
Maintainable E2E test code relies on modularity, using reusable functions for Focus Bear’s WebView actions. Clear naming (e.g., TestFocusSession) and comments enhance readability.

How does the Page Object Model (POM) improve test readability?
POM improves readability by encapsulating Focus Bear’s WebView elements (e.g., buttons) in FocusSessionPage.cs.

Why should repetitive actions (like login steps) be moved to reusable helpers?
Repetitive actions, like logging into Focus Bear, should move to helpers (e.g., login.js) to avoid duplication across tests.

How can a well-structured test suite speed up debugging and test writing?
A well-structured test suite, like /tests/e2e/focus-session, speeds debugging by grouping Focus Bear issues (e.g., 404 errors) logically.
